Exercise 1:
(Loops and how many time they will iterate)

1.) it will stop. first iteration assigns a negative value
	to count, which is < 5. It would end after first iteration
2.) while loop would run 6 times on. j should be value of 28 at end.
	for loop should run 8 times
3.) results of first iterations:p = 2, q = 0
	second: 		p = 2, q = 4
	third: 			p = 4, q = 0
	4th: 			p = 4, q = 8
	5th: 			p = 8, q = 0
	6th:			p = 8, q = 16
	7th: 			p = 16, q = 0
	8th:			p = 16, q = 32
