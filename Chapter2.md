Exercise 1:
(Loops and how many time they will iterate)

1.) it will stop. first iteration assigns a negative value
	to count, which is < 5. It would end after first iteration
2.) while loop would run 6 times on. j should be value of 28 at end.
	for loop should run 8 times
3.) results of 
1.) it will stop. first iteration assigns a negative value
	to count, which is < 5. It would end after first iteration
2.) while loop would run 6 times on. j should be value of 28 at end.
	for loop should run 8 times (miscount, was actually 7)
3.) results of 
    <ol>
    <li>first iterations:p = 2, q = 0 </li>
    <li> second: 		p = 2, q = 4</li>
    <li> third: 			p = 4, q = 0</li>
    <li> 4th: 			p = 4, q = 8</li>
    <li> 5th: 			p = 8, q = 0</li>
    <li> 6th:			p = 8, q = 16</li>
    <li> 7th: 			p = 16, q = 0</li>
    <li> 8th:			p = 16, q = 32</li>
    </ol>
		End
4.) infinite loop. i is never assigned a value other than 0. 
	so i == 0 is always true, and the while loop continues
5.) Without googling, I want to say it would be an infinite loop
	while(true){int i = 1}. But logically I feel there has
	to be a need to an argument that returns a true value
	rather than just stating true.
		(Nope, turns out it was indeed an infinite loop
		and you are allowed to do it. I imagine you could
		have conditions, and each returns a boolean value
		some of which are false)
